    When interpreting user needs for a program I make sure that I cover all the potential use cases and really understand why the user might want to use a particular feature. When implementing these features I look at their importance to not only the user but also to the app. How they work together is very important and requires a lot of testing to properly implement.
    User Stories are an amazing tool in the process of product development. They help to bring the final product that at this poin tis just a dream to life. It breaks the large final product into small workable pieces that can actually be done.
    When developing programs I make sure that the user stories are properly organized in a position that I can work on the ones that are most critical to the program and the user. When I develop programs in the future I will try and organize my program into user stories and try and weigh them in some way so I can work on what matters most first. Ill also use sprints to make sure that I dont waste too much time on things that dont bring the app to life.
  Being a good teamnate means putting the project first. Being on a team means youre all working on the same problem and there is no need to step on each other or put the needs of an individual over others.
